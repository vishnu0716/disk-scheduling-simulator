# Disk Scheduling Simulator

This repository contains the initial structure for the Disk Scheduling Simulator project.
The simulator demonstrates how different OS disk scheduling algorithms work to reduce head movement.

## Commit 2 Includes:
✔ Project base directory structure
✔ main.py initialized
✔ .gitignore added to ignore cache
✔ algorithms/ folder created with .gitkeep to maintain structure

In upcoming commits, we will add algorithms step-by-step:
1. FCFS (First Come First Serve)
2. SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First)
3. SCAN Algorithm
4. C-SCAN Algorithm

Final commits will also include code integration + documentation + test results.
