# disk-scheduling-simulator
The Disk Scheduling Simulator demonstrates how algorithms like FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, and C-SCAN handle disk access requests. It calculates head movement, compares efficiency, and visualizes the path of the disk arm, helping users understand how operating systems optimize disk performance.
